# CHEE-413-Process-Control-and-Simulation-Lab-Code
In this lab, you will build a PID control algorithm in Matlab and use it along with the Ar- duino Uno, Arduino motor shield, valve, motor, and pressure sensor in a feedback loop to control the volume of water in a tank. You will construct a system in which a continuously draining tank is supplied with water via a continuously running centrifugal pump. A pressure transducer mounted on the side of the tank returns a voltage that is proportional to the height of water above the transducer. This voltage serves as the input to the controller. The controller actuates a valve that controls the water level in the tank.
