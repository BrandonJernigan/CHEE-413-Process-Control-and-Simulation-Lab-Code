# CHEE-413-Process-Control-and-Simulation-Lab-Code
In this lab, I built a PID control algorithm in Matlab and used it along with the Arduino Uno, Arduino motor shield, valve, motor, and pressure sensor in a feedback loop to control the volume of water in a tank. I constructed a system in which a continuously draining tank is supplied with water via a continuously running centrifugal pump. A pressure transducer mounted on the side of the tank returned a voltage that was proportional to the height of water above the transducer. This voltage served as the input to the controller. The controller actuated a valve that controled the water level in the tank.
